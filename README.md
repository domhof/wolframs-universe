Wolfram's Universe "on 15th of March 2013"
=================

Algorithmic composition in Supercollider by Dominik Hofer.

How it works: The date 15th of March is transformed into its binary representation and is used as the input to  Wolfram's Universe, a generative algorithm based on simple rules invented by Stephen Wolfram. The evolving generations are then used to form a seqeunce of parallel sine-based sounds, resulting in an interesting ambient composition.
